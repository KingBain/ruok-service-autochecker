# GraphQL API

This folder contains documentation for the GraphQL API component of the ruok-service-autochecker project.

## Getting Started with Local Development

Run `make` to create a local `venv` folder (`.gitignore`d) and `pip install` all of the `requirements.txt` dependencies into the `venv` folder. The default target in the `Makefile` also activates the virtual environment.
