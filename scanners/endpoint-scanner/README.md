## Endpoint Scanner

If alpha.canada.ca - consider reviewing https://alpha.canada.ca/en/instructions.html 
* a “nofollow” meta tag or robots.txt file to prevent indexing by search engines (this probably fits better into the github scanner)
* an “alpha” banner to indicate to users that it is a prototype service
* a feedback or issue-reporting method (either email address, web form, or public issue tracker)

These are interesting resources that might be of use 
* https://github.com/cds-snc/status-statut
* https://github.com/cds-snc/scan-websites

Also:
* DNS takeovers
* Subdomain takeovers
* SLOs established?
* Uptime tracking?
* PHAC data standards - (where do we find these? - there's also this  https://www.dublincore.org/)
